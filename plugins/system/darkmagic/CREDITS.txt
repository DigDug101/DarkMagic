This software would have not been possible without the original work of other people it builds upon.

Isis Dark Mode
==============

It's based on the work of Alek Volsk (https://github.com/AlekVolsk/joomla3-isis-dark-theme) and the improvements made on it by Troy Hall (https://github.com/N6REJ/joomla3-isis-dark-theme).

I slightly tweaked it to fix some inconsistencies I ran into.

TinyMCE Dark Skin
=================

Made with an on-line TinyMCE skin generator and tweaked by hand.

Protostar Dark Mode
===================

It's based on Darkstrap v0.9.1 by danneu (http://github.com/danneu/darkstrap).

I improved on it by taking into account Joomla's modification to the core Bootstrap experience.

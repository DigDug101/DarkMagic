PLG_SYSTEM_DARKMAGIC_DESCRIPTION="<p>Turn off the lights in your Joomla! administrator. Apply a dark theme to your Joomla administrator backend.</p><p>Only works with the default Joomla 3 backend template (Isis). It will NOT WORK with any other template, even if it's based off Isis.</p><p><strong>WARNING!</strong> Installing this plugin also installs a new TinyMCE skin called “charcoal”. Joomla enables it BY DEFAULT without asking you. You must edit the Editor - TinyMCE plugin's options and set your preferred skin IN ALL THREE SETS back to Joomla's default theme “lightgray”. This is a Joomla issue which cannot be worked around in code. Sorry.</p>"
